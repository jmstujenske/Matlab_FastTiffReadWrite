# Matlab_FastTiffReadWrite
 Functions to read tiffs and write tiffs quickly in matlab
 J.M. Stujenske

# 1. Read / Write Functions:
 
bigread4.m -- reads standard and BigTiffs quickly; calls readtifftags.m

FastTiffSave.m -- saves standard and BigTiffs quickly; calls Fast_BigTiff_Write.m and Fast_Tiff_Write.m

Example usage:
imData=bigread4('C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\test.tif');
FastTiffSave(imData,'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\test_copy.tif');


# 2. Memory mapping function:

memory_map_tiff -- memory map a tiff, to read quickly, like you could for a binary file
%Works for all tiffs saved by FastTiffSave, but will work for most other tiffs. A caveat is that the memory mapping can be done in two ways: as a large matrix (which has some advantages for certain manipulation of the data), or a structure with a single entry per frame. The matrix method will only work if the tiff tags are not embedded within the image data and the image data is written as one continuous chunk in the file. Functions like SaveasTiff, the builtin Tiff class, or standard Tiff libraries do not save the Tiffs this way, so you are limited to use the structure based method. This is not a problem with TiffViewer (see below).

Example usage:

m = memory_map_tiff('test.tif',[],2);

channel1_frame1=m.Data(1).channel1;

m = memory_map_tiff('test.tif','matrix',2);

info = readtifftags;

tiff_height=info(1).ImageHeight;

allchannel1data=m.Data.allchans(:,1:tiff_height,:);


# 3. Visualizing tiffs:

TiffViewer -- object class for viewing tiffs (like in ImageJ but much faster, images read virtually with memory mapping but not as slow to make projections like in ImageJ)

example usage:

tv=TiffViewer('test.tif'); %Figure will pop up to visual the tiff

%Note, that this functions best if the tiff can be memory map-able as a structure (true of most tiffs).



# Explanation:

Reading based on script by D. Peterka (modified by E. Pnevmatikakis, currently utilized in CaImAn package and others)


Writing based on solution by R. Harkes:
https://github.com/rharkes/Fast_Tiff_Write


This should give ImageJ speeds for tiff reading and writing, if not quicker.


Memory mapping uses innate Matlab functionality, and TiffViewer is custom written code built around memory mapping.


# More details:
This was written for use with large tiff stacks containing calcium imaging data but works for other applications.
Reading is optimized for uncompressed, grayscale tiff stacks. This improves on bigread2 by expanding functionality (e.g., tiffs can be written in tiles rather than just strips; deals with tiffs with tags stuck in between image data; will call builtin tiff class or bioformats plugin as a contingency for other tiff formats, though these are slower).
Further, I wrote a shortcut for tifftag reading, which assumes that tags don't change between tiffs, that provides a big speedup.

Writing is mostly a wrapper function utilizing the solution written by R. Harkes, which I extended to handle bigtiffs in 2020 (It seems that another independent modification came to basically the same solution, which I discovered when finally posting this to github).
Writing speed will NOT be strictly linear with file size. The writing slows down with increasing frame number. So, it is actually faster to save you data as multiple, smaller tiffs; however, subsequent analysis steps may become more problematic with this method. Please note that BigTiffs are not readable by many standard softwares that work with Tiffs, including certain Python packages.

Rough benchmarks (will depend on your hardware. SSD highly recommended):

512x512x50000 uint16 tiff stack should read in about 2 minutes. Speed up is about 20% faster than bigread2.
(If tifftags are unevenly spaced as done by functions like saveastiff, may be slower and the same speed as bigread2).

The same data should write to disk in about 2.5 minutes.

Reading and writing should only be slightly slower than for binary files.
If tiff files are saved with FastTiffSave, they can be memory mapped in Matlab using the memory_map_tiff.m function!

TiffViewer should be able to open the above tiff stack in about 5 seconds.

If RAM on your device is too low to hold all image data in memory at the same time, you can load in chunks and directly use the
Fast_BigTiff_Write class to write in a loop. Look in the FastTiffSave code for how to use the class.
